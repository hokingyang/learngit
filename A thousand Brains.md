\#读书《A thousand Brains》, written by Jeff Hawkins, Jeff is the cofounder of Numenta, a neuroscience research company; founder of the Redwood Neuroscience Institute; and one of the founders of PALM, the old and famous handheld computing. At the same time, Richard Dawkins is listed as the second author.

This book is very cutting-edge in neuroscience, in which Jeff propose a totally new model about brain, it's thousand brains model.

Seventy percent of our brain, the new brain, is made of one thing: the neocortex. The neocortex is a sheet of tissue about the size of a large napkin. It is divided into dozens of regions that do different things. Each region is divided into thousands of columns. Each column is composed of several hundred hairlike minicolumns, which consist of a little over one hundred cells each.

Before Jeff,  Mountcastle devotes his theory about how Brain works. he proposes that the neocortex regions look similar because they are all doing the same thing. What makes them different is not their intrinsic function but what they are connected to. Actually, Mountcastle is proposing that all the things we associate with intelligence, which on the surface appear to be different, are, in reality, manifestations of the same underlying cortical algorithm.

Mountcastle’s and Darwin’s proposals differ in one interesting way. Darwin knew what the algorithm was: evolution is based on random variation and natural selection. However, Darwin didn’t know where the algorithm was in the body. This was not known until the discovery of DNA many years later. Mountcastle, by contrast, didn’t know what the cortical algorithm was; he didn’t know what the principles of intelligence were. But he did know where this algorithm resided in the brain.

Jeff thinks that he finds the algorithm, and names it as thousand brains. There are three such “aha” moments from Jeff,

- Discovery Number One: The Neocortex Learns a Predictive Model of the World
- Discovery Number Two: Predictions Occur Inside Neurons
- Discovery Number Three: The Secret of the Cortical Column Is Reference Frames

The notions or ideas of "reference frames" and “The very act of thinking is a form of movement”, are each profound enough to fill a book and they are the core concepts for thousand brains model.

The second part of the book is about machine intelligence. The long-term goal of AI research is to create machines that exhibit human-like intelligence, This goal is called “artificial general intelligence,” or AGI, to distinguish it from today’s limited AI. The essential question today’s AI industry faces is: Are we currently on a path to creating truly intelligent AGI machines, or will we once again get stuck and enter another AI winter? maybe we should change our AI path from neural network to thousand brains model. But how? it's an unknow or myth even for Jeff himself.

The third part, Jeff discuss three methods we might pursue to prevent our demise. The first method may or may not work without modifying our genes, the second is based on gene modification, and the third abandons biology altogether.

For the thrid mothod, there are two widely discussed proposals for how humans could combine brains and computers to prevent our death and extinction. One is uploading our brains into computers, and the other is merging our brains with computers. Uploading your brain allows you to live forever, and merging your brain gives you superhuman abilities.

But, “Uploading your brain” is a misleading phrase. Essentially, What you have really done is split yourself into two people; "merged with a computer" still has a biological brain and body that will decay and die. Importantly, neither proposal addresses the existential risks facing humanity.

Finally, knowledge is just the name for what we have learned about the world. Your knowledge is the model of the world that resides in your neocortex. Humanity’s knowledge is the sum of what we have learned individually.

The neocortex learns a model of the world, and it is this model that makes us intelligent. Intelligence evolved because it, too, is useful for propagating genes. We are here as servants to our genes, but the balance of power between the old brain and new brain has started to shift.
