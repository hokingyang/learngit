\#读书《The Next 500 Years》, written by Christopher E. Mason.

Since Chris. has the working exprience in NASA, his book has essentially engineering characteristic. he makes a detail plan for next 500 years, and lists the targeted tasks every 50 years. all of those tasks are genetic related.

- Phase 1: The Landscape of Functional Genomics (2010–2020)

  Thanks to decades of human innovation and engineering, CRISPR is now an integral part of molecular biology and clinical care. This rapid development of biological editing and engineering methods will continue to accelerate in the coming 500 years.

- Phase 2: Preliminary Engineering of Genomes (2021–2040)

  All genes from all organisms will become a playground for creating and making new functions in human cells. the research showed that elephants’ cells are more sensitive to DNA damage from radiation, we can add extra copies of TP53 to human cells and get them to be more resistant to cancer.

- Phase 3: Long-Term Trials of Human and Cellular Engineering (2041–2100)

  By the dawn of 2100, all the genes, cells, and even potentially organs of any organism can become a component of a human cell. we can start to use all the lessons of evolution on Earth to survive beyond Earth.

- Phase 4: Preparing Humans for Space (2101–2150)

  By 2150, there should be a permanent base of people on the moon, and on Mars we’ll begin to build a more permanent station. In this era, human cells will become more complicated, modified, and blended between species, with cells and entire organisms becoming hybrids.

- Phase 5: Synthetic Biology for New Homes (2151–2200)

  by 2150, including having a child by yourself without ever actually having to give birth, same-sex couple children, opposite-sex couple children, three-parent babies, and perhaps even “build your own” children from more than three people with synthesized segments of their genomes combined. This opens a new era of completely free cellular, reproductive, and parental liberty created by biological engineering.

- Phase 6: Expanding the Limits of Life (2201–2250)

  By 2250, living on other celestial bodies in our solar system will require some extensive engineering, including: high/low temperature (thermophile/psychrophile), high pressure (barophile or piezophile), high salinity (halophile), high/low pH (alkaliphile/acidophile), and high radiation (radiophile). we would have the first human cells that are autotrophic, or at least prototrophic, and are further endowed with new functions which improve the length, and quality, of life. Astronauts on Mars may begin to approach the life expectancy of humans on Earth. The first baby would be born on Mars. And the plans could be finalized for the first human mission to Titan.

- Phase 7: Test a Generation Ship and Settle Harsh Worlds (2251–2350)

  The technology to engage human hibernation or diapause could be ready by 2251. So an idea of a “genesis probe” that could seed other planets with Earth-based microbes, should be the best means to prepare a planet for our arrival with some microbes that we would want to be there first. Ideally, this would be done only once robotic probes have conducted an extensive analysis of the planet to decrease the chance of causing harm to any life which may already exist there.

- Phase 8: Settle New Earths (2351–2400)

  By 2400, we will want to target the best candidates, and we will want to have satellites around as many planets as possible, not just around Earth. Goods may come in digital form, such as point-to-point biology trade between ships, planets, and stars, as well as the creation of rare physical goods derived and created in new locations. Ideally, there will be a rich exchange of ideas, products, and knowledge between systems fulfilling the deontogenic duty as humans (or subsequent form of sentience) across a whole society.

- Phase 9: Launch toward the Second Sun (2401–2500)

  the majority (or potentially all) of genetic disease will no longer cause human suffering. DNA sequencers (readers) and synthesizers (writers) will be both accurate and common.The ability to selectively turn on genes, redirect cells, and recreate tissues of interest within the body can have a profound impact on the places to which a body can travel and the degree of self-control over one’s own cells. Some level of this cellular liberty is, to a degree, already present in the twenty-first century in the form of sex-reassignment therapies and surgeries.

- Phase 10: Optimistic Unknowns (Beyond 2500)

  Humans are capable of creating new universe in their heads through the selective firing of billions of neurons currently. Preserving this adaptive, creative genesis of ideas, dreams and goals is our duty, not only to our species and to this planet, but to all species and to all planets.
